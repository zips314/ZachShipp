# About Me
## Personal Background
I grew up in **St. Louis**, Missouri, and I am 18 years old. I am a big fan of the city I grew up in and have a lot of love for it. I have 3 siblings and 2 dogs back at home. I went to private school for grade school and high school. I have played sports all of my life, mainly football, basketball, and baseball. I am currently an Engineering Student at the University of Missouri, and I am majoring in Information Technology. This is because I have lived a life surrounded by tech and I am ever curious. I hope that one day I can use what I have learned about coding to make an impact on the world.
