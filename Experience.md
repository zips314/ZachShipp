# Experience
## Coding 
Before coming to Mizzou, I had no prior experience to coding, however, I have always been curious and willing to learn. When I got to Mizzou, I was registered in 2 classes that have helped me understand coding. In one class I have learned the basics of writing in Python, HTML, Javascript, and now Markdown. In the other class, it mainly focuses on coding in Python, so I would say I am most experienced in Python. At first, coding was hard to understand, however I have gotten better at understanding concepts and why things work the way they do. My biggest weakness would perhaps be my lack of creativity when writing.  I have now been coding for almost 2 months, and I have begun to uncover a real passion for coding.

## Tech
I have always been very interested in technology, ever since my brother and I got an _Xbox 360_ for Christmas when I was 7. Growing up I was always excited to hop on the family computer. When I got older, I began to learn more and more about computers and more specifically hardware. I eventually bought parts for a PC and built my own. Upon my arrival to Mizzou, this was the most I had explored into computers. Now, I am super excited to learn about the software, and how everything works.
